# Task Scheduler

Created a robust task management system capable of scheduling, organizing, and prioritizing tasks, ensuring execution at specific times or under predefined conditions. This system will maintain a log of task execution and handle errors in case of failure. It allows for seamless addition, configuration, and removal of tasks while efficiently managing a large number of concurrent tasks.
